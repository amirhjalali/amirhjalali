## ⚡ Featured Projects

### 🧠 Argumend

**AI-powered tool for balanced perspectives on complex issues.**

Online discourse suffers from echo chambers and one-sided arguments. Argumend uses large language models to analyze contentious topics and surface multiple viewpoints — helping users understand the full landscape of an issue before forming opinions.

> The goal isn't to tell people what to think, but to ensure they've considered what others think.

### ⚖️ DebateMePro

**Objective debate scoring using systematic evaluation methodology.**

Most online debates devolve into who can shout loudest. DebateMePro brings structure and objectivity — evaluating arguments on logic, evidence, rhetoric, and intellectual honesty. Think of it as instant replay review for debates.

> Built to encourage better argumentation by making the quality of reasoning visible and measurable.
