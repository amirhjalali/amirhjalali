## Featured Projects

### Argumend

**AI-powered tool for balanced perspectives on complex issues.**

Online discourse suffers from echo chambers and one-sided arguments. Argumend uses large language models to analyze contentious topics and surface multiple viewpoints — helping users understand the full landscape of an issue before forming opinions.

The goal isn't to tell people what to think, but to ensure they've considered what others think.

### DebateMePro

**Objective debate scoring using systematic evaluation methodology.**

Most online debates devolve into who can shout loudest. DebateMePro brings structure and objectivity — evaluating arguments on logic, evidence, rhetoric, and intellectual honesty. Think of it as instant replay review for debates.

Built to encourage better argumentation by making the quality of reasoning visible and measurable.

## Technical Background

**Languages:** TypeScript · Python · PHP
**Domains:** Large Language Models · Data Engineering · Business Intelligence · API Architecture
**Focus Areas:** AI Strategy · Prompt Engineering · Generative AI Applications

I've spent 14+ years working across the data stack — from warehousing and BI dashboards to modern AI implementations. My current focus is on practical applications of LLMs: tools that solve real problems rather than demos that impress briefly.

## Current Interests

- **Improving online discourse** — Can AI help people argue better, not just louder?
- **Creator economy infrastructure** — Building tools that help creators succeed
- **Practical AI workflows** — Moving beyond chatbots to embedded intelligence

Always interested in conversations about AI strategy and implementation.
